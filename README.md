# Bionic Arm Controlled by Flex Sensors and Accelerometer

## Overview
This project presents a robotic arm that mimics the real-time movements of a human hand using three flex sensors and an accelerometer. The sensors are mounted on a wearable glove, translating user hand gestures into movements of the robotic arm. The arm is powered by servo motors controlled via a Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Features
- **Real-Time Motion Mimicry**: Replicates hand movements accurately using flex sensors and accelerometer data.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Provides smooth motion with PWM signals.
- **Modular and Extendable**: Designed for easy modification and enhancements.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Utilizes a power-efficient Raspberry Pi Pico board.
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Prevents overloading of motors with angle clamping.
